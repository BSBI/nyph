      How to add a new record
    </a>
    <p id="c1" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" aria-expanded="false">
      There are two ways to add a record.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Taking a photo</strong>
      <br>
      Press the camera button <span class="icon icon-camera"></span> in the home
      page header. This will prompt you to select a photo to upload or activate the camera on your mobile device.
      Once you have a photo, the app will create a new record without any
      species associated with it.<br>
      Clicking on the newly created record will open the taxa search page.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Selecting a species</strong>
      <br>
      Please press the plus <span class="icon icon-plus"></span> button in the home page header.
      This will bring you to the taxon search page. After selecting the species,
      open the record (either by opening it directly from the taxon search page
      using the edit button <span class="icon edit"></span> beside the species name or through
      the home-list page)
      <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="table-view-cell">
    <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"
       href="#c2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="c2">
      <span class="icon icon-collapse pull-left"></span>
      Searching for species
    </a>
    <p id="c2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" aria-expanded="false">
      You can search using scientific or English names. Keep typing until the name you want appears on the list.
      <br>
      If you don't know the name of the plant then leave the search box blank and click on 'Unknown flowering plant'
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="table-view-cell">
    <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"
       href="#c3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="c3">
      <span class="icon icon-collapse pull-left"></span>
      Sending your list
    </a>
    <p id="c3" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" aria-expanded="false">
      Records are not saved until you click on the <strong>Send</strong> button (top-right corner of the
      record-list page). You can do this at any point, provided that you have a network connection.
      <br>
      Records cannot be sent until all the required details are completed.  You need to fill in two fields
      at the top of the main list to give your name(s) (or the name of your group); the place where you started
      your Plant Hunt or did most searching.
      <br>
      Each record must have a species name (or if you selected 'Unknown plant' then you must provide a photograph).
      <br>
      Each record must have a grid-reference. Usually this will have been filled in automatically using GPS if you
      are recording using a mobile phone.
      <br>
      Once a record has been saved, a green airplane symbol <span class="icon icon-send" style="color: green;"></span>
      appears next to it in the list. Entries that haven't yet saved either because of a failed connection or
      because some details are missing will have a warning message.  Retry sending these records once you have provided
      any missing details and have a good connection again.

    </a>
    <p id="locks" class="collapse"

      You can lock record attributes like date, location, number etc, which will
      preserve your current attribute value for the subsequently added records.
      <br>
      To lock an attribute click on the lock <span class="icon icon-lock-open"></span>
      button in the attribute edit page header. This will change the symbol to
      locked <span class="icon icon-lock-closed"></span> both on the button and next to the attribute.

      This will clear all records from your current list, so please make sure that you have saved that list first.
