    <p><strong>Welcome to the BSBI's 2017 New Year Plant Hunt</strong></p>
    <p>
      For the sixth year running you are cordially invited to join in our
      BSBI New Year Plant Hunt. The aim is to find and record as many wild
      species in bloom as you can in up to three hours over the New Year
      period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are simple to try to keep data comparable between different
      areas and over different years:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick a day over the New Year between Sunday 1st and Wednesday 4th January 2017, when the
        weather is decent enough to record in.</li>
      <li>Record wild and naturalised plants in flower (but not planted
        species in gardens or parks). Please check that plants are actually flowering: that catkins are open, that grasses have open florets, stigmas or anthers on show etc.</li>
      <li>Record for up to 3 hours (you can “stop the clock” for tea-breaks and
        comfort stops!)</li>
      <li>You can contribute as many different lists as you like from
        different areas between 1st and 4th January, as long as you don’t exceed the 3 hour limit for each new list.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    <p><strong>About the App</strong></p>
    <p>
      We hope that most Plant Hunters will use our new app this year - it’s the easiest way for you to send records and will help us to process your results much more quickly.
      If you encounter any problems then please email us:  <a href='mailto:nyplanthunt@bsbi.org'>nyplanthunt@bsbi.org</a>
    </p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>What happens to the records</strong></p>
    <p>
      Records from the App will be checked by the Botanical Society of
      Britain & Ireland and may be added to our database.
      The New Year Plant Hunt is partly for fun - an excuse
      to get outside and look at some plants! - but by repeating
      this project each year we can see if any interesting trends
      are beginning to emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
