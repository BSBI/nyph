    <p><strong>Use of your name</strong></p>

    <p>Plant Hunt records that you send will be associated with the name(s) that you enter in the participants field.
      We retain this information because the name of the recorder is an important part of a biological record. The name(s) you enter
      form part of a permanent plant occurrence record, that may appear as part of publicly accessible records.</p>
      <p>We respect your right to anonymity, so if you prefer then you could enter the name of your group, first names only, or some
      pseudonym of your choice.<p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>E-mail address</strong></p>

    <p>If you choose to provide your email address then this will be used to send notifications about your plant records
      and New Year Plant Hunt progress reports and results.</p>
      <p>Your email address will not be shown and disseminated with your records but will be
      available to the verifying experts if they need to contact you about your sightings. You are
      able to opt out of receiving emails at any time.</p>
      <p>Only those directly involved in running the New Year Plant Hunt will have access to your email address.</p>
