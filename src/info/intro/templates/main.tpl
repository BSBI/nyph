      <strong>Welcome to the BSBI's <br> 2017 New Year Plant Hunt</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please follow these rules, so that the records collected are comparable.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick a day over the New Year weekend between Sunday 1<sup>st</sup> and Wednesday 4<sup>th</sup> January 2017, when the
        weather is decent enough to record in.</li>
      <li>Plan to walk for up to three hours (but you can take breaks), recording as many wild or 
      naturalised plants in flower as you can, but ignore planted species in gardens or parks.
      </li><li>Please check that plants are actually flowering: that catkins are open, that grasses have open florets, stigmas or anthers on show etc.</li>
      <li>You can contribute as many different lists as you like from
        different areas, as long as you donâ€™t exceed the 3 hour limit for each list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
